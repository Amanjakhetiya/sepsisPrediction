<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Sepsis is a severe and time-sensitive condition in which the body has a sustained and dysregulated response to infection. Sepsis that is untreated can quickly progress to multiorgan dysfunction, significantly increasing the risk of death. Earlier and timely treatment has been identified to reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. <br>
Critically ill patients are admitted to the ICU where they receive complex and time-sensitive care from a wide array of clinical staff. These patients are attached to a number of medical devices that produce data on a continuous basis. However, in current practice, much of this data is lost as only a handful of data are recorded as vitals every 2 hours. <br>
Recent work has suggested that features or ‘physiomarkers’ generated from continuous physiological data streams can predict the onset of physiological deterioration in adults. Increasing the frequency of those vitals, from ones captured hourly to minutes, has been
shown to improve the predictive performance of such models. In this project, we apply machine learning methods to generate descriptive features that are clinically meaningful and predict the onset of sepsis.
